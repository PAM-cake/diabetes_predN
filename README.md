##Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Project
##This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning techniques. The workflow involves several key stages to ensure accurate and reliable predictions:

#Workflow:
#Data Collection: The dataset is gathered from various reliable sources, containing relevant features such as age, glucose levels, BMI, etc.

#Preprocessing: The data undergoes cleaning, handling of missing values, and outlier removal to ensure quality input for the model.

#Standardization: The features are standardized to bring them to a common scale, ensuring the model can effectively learn from them.

#Train-Test Split (TTS): The dataset is split into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model is trained on one subset and tested on another for unbiased evaluation.

#Model Training: We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to train the model, a powerful algorithm for classification tasks.

#Accuracy Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics, and further optimization can be applied to improve results.

#This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for diabetes prediction using machine learning, ensuring a structured approach to model building, training, and evaluation.
